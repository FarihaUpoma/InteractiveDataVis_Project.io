# project3-skeleton

For Project 3 submission, I have worked on Titanic and Calvin Data. I have two visualizations for Iris data as well. After pushing the final work, I thought of including a line on the title of the Iris.html, that says that those are my extra charts. But mistakenly I put that line in the titanic.html. I am not changing the commit as it is past deadline. But just wanted you to know my project 3 datasets are calvin and titanic.

I'd also request to be regraded for project 2, as I was not able to complete them at that time.
